# MetaGreenData

GreenMetaData is a **prototype framework (tool and metadata format) for reporting the environmental impacts of research projects in a standardised way**. 
This first version (1.0) focuses on impacts from computing, but it can also include other aspects (e.g. travel and experimental work to obtain the datasets) at a later stage. 
Researchers and software developers can use GreenMetaData to communicate the environmental impacts of their research projects and inform e.g. journals, funders, fellow researchers and computing site administrators. 
For this, they can complete a form with information on their software product with pre-defined fields across relevant impact categories, and obtain a yaml file generated by the tool. 

## Use cases

The **standardised file output** is intended to enable easy comparison between the environmental impacts of research projects and enable reflections and continuous improvements towards more sustainable research (computing). It can be included in research publications - which in turn provides an opportunity for funders and journal or conference organisers to encourage authors to be transparent about the impacts for their work.

## Structure

The GreenMetaData form uses the following structure for guiding users through the process of reporting relevant impacts across the different parts of their research project. 
Users can complete as many or as few fields as they have the data for. 
In the future, we plan to directly pre-populate the form fields with the information from carbon reporting tools and their configuration, but the user can also input values manually.
